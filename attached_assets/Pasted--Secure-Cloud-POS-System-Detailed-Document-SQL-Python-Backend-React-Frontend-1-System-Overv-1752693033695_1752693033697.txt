ðŸš€ Secure Cloud POS System Detailed Document (SQL + Python Backend + React Frontend)
1. System Overview
Name: Secure Cloud POS System

Purpose: A cloud-based point-of-sale (POS) system designed to streamline billing, inventory, and payment processing for businesses. It includes features such as split payments, multi-rate pricing, barcode scanning, GST management, and offline support.

Deployment: Cloud-hosted solution with offline capability, ensuring business continuity even during power outages.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React.js

Backend: Python (Flask/Django)

Database: SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL)

Payment Gateway: Cloud-based payment gateway integration (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay)

Barcode Scanning: Integration with barcode scanners for product entry.

2. Functional Modules
2.1 Payment and Billing Management
Split Payment After Bill Generation:

After generating the bill, the system will allow users to split the payment across different methods (e.g., cash, card, wallet, etc.).

The backend will process multiple payment methods, update the total payment status, and log the payments for each method.

Cloud-Hosted Payment Gateway:

Integration with a secure, cloud-hosted payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay) for processing online payments.

Support for credit/debit card payments, wallets, and bank transfers.

Product Rate Management:

Dropdown for selecting rates:

Wholesale Rate

Counter Sale Rate

Multiple Customer Rate (manual input by the user).

Rates are stored in the SQL database with relationships to the customer type and product type.

GST Management for Products:

Each product will have a unique GST value, and the system will allow for multi-GST numbers (based on different calendar years).

The invoice system will enable modifications to the company name and GST number for retroactive changes to invoices, if customers request a GST bill after a week.

Friendly User Interface for Billing:

The billing interface will be user-friendly and intuitive.

Real-time updates will show invoice totals, applicable taxes, and payment status.

The system will display the amount and transaction ID on the screen once payment is processed.

POS System Integration:

The POS system will allow products to be added by barcode scanning or manual entry.

Items can be sold in pieces, kgs, or packages, and the rate will adjust accordingly.

A cart summary will include the quantity, subtotal, VAT, and total.

Product Item Tracking:

The system will handle 240 products in the product catalog.

Each product will be sold in specific units like pieces, kgs, or packages, and the conversion rates will be handled.

Post-Sale Summary with Barcode Scanning:

After the sale is completed, a detailed summary of scanned products will be displayed, showing the name, quantity, and total price of each item.

2.2 Offline Functionality & Synchronization
Offline Mode:

The POS system should be able to function during power outages by logging transactions locally (using SQLite or local SQL databases for offline use).

Once the connection is restored, data will automatically sync to the cloud-hosted database.

2.3 Customer and Invoice Management
Invoice Editing:

Ability to edit invoices for the same company, allowing for the correction of GST numbers and company name if needed.

The system will track two different GST numbers for the same company based on calendar years.

Customer Statement:

A customer statement will track all payments and invoices for each customer, which can be accessed through the customer management module.

Display Transaction Information:

After payment completion, the amount paid and the transaction ID will be shown on the display for both the cashier and customer.

2.4 Attendance & Employee Management
Attendance Software:

Track the attendance of 250 employees working in a factory.

Employees can clock in and out via the app, and their working hours will be recorded in the system.

Reports can be generated for leave management, overtime, and payroll calculation.

3. System Features Breakdown
3.1 Dashboard and Reporting
Invoice and Payment Summary:

Overview of total revenue, pending payments, and invoices based on their status (drafted, sent, overdue).

Graphs and charts showing revenue by customer and monthly revenue trends.

Product and Sales Analytics:

Insights into the best-selling products, categories, and customer types.

Visual reports, including pie charts and bar graphs, for product and sales performance.

3.2 User Management & Security
Role-Based Access Control:

Admins will have full access to the entire system, while cashiers, HR, and other users will have restricted access based on their roles.

Secure login with user roles and access permissions defined.

Data Security:

SSL/TLS encryption for secure communication.

Two-factor authentication (2FA) for admins to ensure the security of sensitive operations.

Encryption of sensitive data like employee payroll and payment details.

4. System Architecture & Technology Stack
4.1 Frontend: React.js
UI Components: React-based components will handle the user interface, including dynamic views for product sales, invoices, and reports.

State Management: Use Redux for managing global state (e.g., cart, invoice).

Routing: Use React Router for navigation between pages (e.g., Dashboard, Products, Sales).

UI Design: Styled using Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern look.

4.2 Backend: Python (Flask or Django)
API Layer: Expose RESTful APIs using Flask or Django REST Framework to handle frontend requests (e.g., create invoices, add products, etc.).

Business Logic: Implement logic for payment processing, rate management, offline syncing, and GST calculation.

Database ORM: Use SQLAlchemy (for Flask) or Django ORM for easy interaction with the SQL database.

4.3 Database: SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
Product Management: A table for storing products, including fields like name, category, rate, GST number, etc.

Invoice Management: Store all invoice data, including transaction date, customer info, products sold, GST calculations, and payments made.

Customer and Employee Management: Maintain customer details (name, contact info, balance) and employee attendance records.
