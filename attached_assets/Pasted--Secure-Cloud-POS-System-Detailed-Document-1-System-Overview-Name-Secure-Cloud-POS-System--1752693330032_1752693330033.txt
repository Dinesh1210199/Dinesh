2. Functional Modules
2.1 Payment and Billing Management
1.	Split Payment After Bill Generation:
o	After a bill is generated, the user can split the payment into multiple methods (e.g., cash, card, wallet, etc.).
o	Each method will be logged separately but will update the overall payment status for the transaction.
2.	Cloud-Hosted Payment Gateway:
o	Integration with a secure cloud payment gateway (such as Stripe or Razorpay) for handling online transactions.
o	Supports credit/debit card payments and wallet payments.
3.	Product Rate Management:
o	Dropdown for selecting rates:
ï‚§	Wholesale Rate
ï‚§	Counter Sale Rate
ï‚§	Multiple Customer Rate (manual input by the user)
o	Rates vary based on customer type, quantity, or promotional offers.
4.	GST Management for Products:
o	Each product will have a unique GST value associated.
o	The system should allow multi-GST numbers for a single company, considering different calendars for invoicing (e.g., financial year vs. calendar year).
o	Enable editing of GST numbers for a company on invoice creation if the customer requests a GST bill after 1 week or later.
5.	Friendly User Interface for Billing:
o	The UI should be intuitive, with clear input fields for product scanning, amount entry, and payment details.
o	The system should provide real-time updates, including invoice totals, GST, and payment methods.
o	After payment, the amount and transaction ID will be shown on the display for both cashier and customer.
6.	POS System Integration:
o	A seamless POS interface where products can be added via barcode scanning or manual input.
o	Items sold in pieces, kgs, or packages should be supported, with appropriate rate adjustments based on the unit.
o	A scanner should be used for product identification and pricing (with barcodes tied to products).
7.	Product Item Tracking:
o	Keep track of 240 different items in the sales product list.
o	Product sales in pieces, kilograms (kgs), and packages must be logged separately with conversion rates.
8.	Post-Sale Summary with Barcode Scanning:
o	After a sale, a detailed summary of all scanned items should appear with product names, quantities, and total prices.
o	The summary will be displayed on the cashierâ€™s screen and printed for the customer.

2.2 Offline Functionality & Synchronization
1.	Offline Mode:
